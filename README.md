ABCD was initially developed by [Bireme](http://regional.bvsalud.org/local/Site/bireme/I/homepage.htm) with the support of [VLIR/UOS](https://www.vliruos.be/en/home/1) and based on [UNESCO-supported ISIS-technology](http://www.unesco.org/isis).

It is based on [FPDF](http://www.fpdf.org/) and [HTML2FPDF](http://html2fpdf.sourceforge.net/)
(see [CREDITS](CREDITS.txt)), with a number of enhancements. mPDF was written by Ian Back and is released
under the [GNU GPL v2 licence](LICENSE.txt).
